## UEFA-schedules - Ruby or Rails with JavaScript/AJAX front-end

## Introduction

This is an API web application with a back-end built on Ruby on Rails and the front-end built with JavaScript and Bootstrap. This is my fourth project for the Flatiron School, Web Developer program.

This app utilizes data from an external API and processes this data on the RoR back-end through service objects and controllers. The information is then rendered via AJAX using jQuery and vanilla JAvaScript. 

There is a limit of 10 requests per minute.
